endpoint: 	a function like POST or DELETE available through shared base routes: /user/post-data or /user/delete-data
database: 	a structured set of data held that is accessible in various ways
database table: 	used in relational databases to store data; a flat file with vertical columns and horizontal rows
data model: 	server code that mirrors the structure of a database table
encryption: 	the conversion of data into encoded data to hide its true value: "mypassword" -> "2XKLJlkjasdlfl83"
statelessness:	the idea that a client and server forget each other after each request/response lifecycle
session:    	a timed meeting between two different devices or applications
token:      	allows a server to identify a client more easily between requests
authentication: 	the process of comparing credentials provided by a client with those found in a database
SQL:        	a language used to query a relational database
migration:  	the process of updating a database table if a data model changes
